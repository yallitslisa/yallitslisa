- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Lisa McWilliams.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning SQL, Tableau, Python and R for data analytics! 
- ðŸ¦ˆ I'm a Marine Biologist, but I hope to learn various coding languages through data analytics so that I can work in a remote position for marine conservation.
- ðŸ¤“ Iâ€™m currently learning through DataCamp, the Google Data Analytics course on Coursera, and Charlotte Chaze's Break Into Tech bootcamp! I am also using The Big Book of Small Python Projects to play around with new projects and ideas.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: my LinkedIn of course! Just search my name!
